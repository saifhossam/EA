Objective Function: This function evaluates the quality of a solution, which in the case of the TSP, is the total distance traveled by the salesman. 
	The objective is to minimize this distance.

Initial Solution: A starting point or solution for the TSP, often generated randomly or through heuristics.

Temperature Schedule: Simulated Annealing involves the concept of temperature, which controls the acceptance of worse solutions during the search.
	 The temperature decreases gradually over time according to a predefined schedule. Common temperature schedules include exponential cooling, linear cooling, or adaptive schedules.

Neighborhood Structure: Describes how to generate neighboring solutions from the current solution. 
	In the context of the TSP, this could involve methods such as swapping two cities in the tour or reversing a subset of cities.

Acceptance Criterion: Determines whether to accept a new solution or not based on its quality and the current temperature. 
	Worse solutions are accepted probabilistically to escape local optima, especially at higher temperatures.

Stopping Criterion: Defines when to stop the search process. 
	This could be a maximum number of iterations, reaching a certain temperature threshold, or when the algorithm converges to a satisfactory solution.

Cooling Rate: Specifies the rate at which the temperature decreases during the annealing process. 
	It influences the balance between exploration and exploitation in the search space.
